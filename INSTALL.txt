Project: Ad blocking using Pi-Hole
Platform: Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based Linux)

1. System Requirements
	-Raspberry Pi (64-bit ARM)
	-Raspberry Pi OS
	-Internet Connection
	-User with 'sudo' privileges

2. Install Pi-Hole
Pi-Hole was installed using the official automated installation script.

From your home directory, open the terminal and run:
	curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash

When prompted, pick these following options that we selected during our installation:
	-Network interface: eth0 (Ethernet)
	-IPv4 address (initial): 192.168.0.124
	-Upstream DNS provider: Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
	-Web admin interface: Enabled
	-Query logging: Enabled
	-Privacy Level: 0 (show all queries)
	-Default blocklist: Steven Black's Unified Hosts List
	
3. Automatic Configuration Performed by Installer
Pi-Hole automatically :
	-Installs all required dependencies
	-Created the pihole system user and group
	-Installed Pi-Hole Core and Web Interface
	-Installed and configured the DNS engine
	
4. Static IP Address
During installation, Pi-hole was initially configured with the following IPv4 address:
	192.168.0.124
	
5. Accessing Web Interface
The Pi-Hole admin dashboard can be accessed at:
	http://192.168.0.124/admin
or
	http://pi.hole:80/admin

6. Admin Password
During installation, an admin password was generated.
If you want to change it, run this in the terminal:
	pihole setpassword
	
7. Configure Client Device(s)
To enable network-wide ad blocking, configure client device(s) / router to use
the Pi-Hole IP address as the DNS server:
	Final DNS IP on our network:
		192.168.1.80

8. Verifying Installation
To check Pi-Hole service status, run:
	pihole status

9. Verifying ad blocking
By viewing the queries in the Query Log via the web interface

10. Installation Log
Full installation log is stored in:
	/etc/pihole/install.log
	
Notes
	-Pi-hole operates as a DNS sinkhole, blocking ads and trackers at the network level
	-No browser extensions are required
	-All DNS filtering is centrally managed through the web interface
	
	-IMPORTANT: IP addresses may vary between systems and network environments.
	 During setup, the Pi-hole instance was assigned different IP addresses
	 (e.g. 192.168.0.124) before settling on the final operational DNS IP of
	 192.168.1.80. Users installing Pi-hole on a different network should use
	 the IP address assigned to their own device.
