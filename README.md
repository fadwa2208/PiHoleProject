# Ad-Blocking Using Pi-hole

## Description

Our project aims to use a Raspberry Pi as an ad-blocker. Using Debian as our distribution, we will install Pi-Hole (ad-blocking application) in order to block advertisements and to prevent compagnies to track our personal data on a network level. This will be done by connecting the Raspberry Pi to the modem of our home. Our goal is to protect users from unwanted content and to protect their network as a whole. This way, it’ll be impossible for their data to be leaked and tracked by multi-billion-dollar compagnies to make profit off of it.
