Technical Choices and Justifications

This document explains the main decisions we took throughout the
brainstorming and development of the Ad-Blocking using Pi-Hole project.
For each choice made, we describe the alternatives (if present) considered
and the reasoning behind our final decision.


1. Hardware Choices
Choice: Raspberry Pi 3B+

Alternatives Considered:
	-Raspberry Pi Zero W
	-Raspberry Pi 4
	-Old laptop / desktop
	
Reason of Choice:
We chose the Raspberry Pi 3B+ because it's the best option
price, performance, and accessibility wise.
	-Contains enough processing power to run Pi-Hole
	-Contains the perfect amount of storage for the project
		(Raspberry Pi 4 has too much, Raspberry Pi Zero W not enough)
	-Affordable cost and highly accessible to obtain
		compared to the Raspberry Pi 4


2. Operating System Choices
Choice: Debian based Raspberry Pi OS

Alternative Considered:
	-Ubuntu Server for Raspberry Pi
	
Reason of Choice:
We chose the Debian based Raspberry Pi OS because it's:
	-Officially supported by both the Raspberry Pi
		Foundation and Pi-Hole
	-Stable and Reliable for network-level tasks


3. Ad-Blocking Software Choices
Choice: Pi-Hole

Alternative Considered:
	-AdGuard Home

Reason of Choice:
We chose Pi-Hole because it's:
	-Very easy to install
	-Reliable and well-known within the networking community
	-Designed specifically for network-wide ad-blocking
	-Free and Open-Source
	-Accessible and contains tons of tutorials
	
	
4. Installation Method Choices
Choice: curl -sSl https://install.pi-hole.net | bash

Alternative Considered:
	-Manual installation from GitHub sources
	-Docker installation

Reason of Choice:
We chose the curl installer because it's the recommended, quickest,
and most reliable method.
	-Automatically installs all dependencies
	-Ensures compatibility with Raspberry Pi OS
	-Saves time and reduces mistakes
	-Convenient


5. Demonstration Choice
Choice: Video Demonstration

Showcasing:
	-Browsing with ads
	-Browsing after Pi-Hole is enabled
	-Improvements in privacy, loading speed, and user experience
	-Comparison between with and without Pi-hole
	
Reason of Choice:
It's safer to film a video showcasing how it works when connected
to the modem back home. Live demos might fail due to network conditons.

6. License Choices
Choice: MIT License

Alternatives Considered:
	-GPL v3
	-Proprietary license
	
Reason of Choice:
We chose the MIT License because it's:
	-Simple and easy to understand
	-Highly permissive
	-Good for educational projects
	-Requires no copyleft obligations
	-Allows users to use and modify the project freely
